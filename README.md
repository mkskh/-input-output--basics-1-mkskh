---focus on opening files for reading and practicing the use of the position---

t1. Open the file src/data/task1.txt and print its entire content with the least amount of instructions possible
t2. Output the amount of ToDos written in the file src/data/task2.txt.
t3. Open the file src/data/task3.txt and print its entire content as you did on Task 1. You will see a text that seems mixed up:
  ---This text has been manipulated so that it only reads well if we print the odd lines first and then the even lines. Write some Python code that opens this file and prints first the odd lines and then the even lines.---
t4. Open the file src/data/task4.txt and print the text found between the positions 1622 and 1634 (both included).
t5. Open the file src/data/task5.txt and print the first line and the amount of characters in this line (the line break does not count).
    ---not allowed to use the len() ---
t6. Now open the file src/data/task6.txt and print a list of integers representing the amount of characters per line. The order in the list will be the order of the lines.
    ---not allowed to use the len() ---
